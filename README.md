# Music App

A platform where you can buy music projects. I was exploring nextjs and made this as a practice project. Component library: used is Aceternity UI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
